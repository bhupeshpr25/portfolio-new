				Hello again! I&apos;m Bhupesh, and I like to build things with code.
				<br />
				<br />
				My first experience with computers was in middle school when I got to try out computers in our
				school computer lab. I didn&apos;t go beyond MS Paint and Word, but I was fascinated by the creative
				possibilities. I have always been interested in gadgets, ever since I was a kid, and I used to
				collect tech magazines in my school years. I eventually pursued the dream of becoming a software
				engineer and working to create and maintain useful and unique applications.
				<br />
				<br />
				Since then, I&apos;ve been improving my skills in software development while constantly learning
				new tools and technologies. Currently, I am in my final year of a computer science undergraduate
				course, and I&apos;m seeking a developer role where I can help a team achieve their goal of building
				great products.
